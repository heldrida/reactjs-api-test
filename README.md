	Build a simple search web app using React and ES6. 

	The app should display a search input and a grid of search results. Each search result should be rendered as a React component and the search results should update when the user types in the search input.

	Feel free to use a public API of your choice. Some public APIs can be found here: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

	The app should utilise at least two features introduced to JavaScript in ES6.

	# React Programming Challenge

	Build a simple search web app using React and ES6. 

	The app should display a search input and a grid of search results. Each search result should be rendered as a React component and the search results should update when the user types in the search input.

	Feel free to use a public API of your choice. Some public APIs can be found here: https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

	The app should utilise at least two features introduced to JavaScript in ES6.

	## Getting Started

	These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
	Clone the repository to your local environment, install any dependencies and install the packages. Run the development command to start a local server, run the build command to create a new version for release.

	### Prerequisities

	```
	NodeJS + NPM
	```

	### Installing

	```
	npm install
	```

	```
	npm run build
	```

	### Development

	```
	gulp dev
	```	

	### Build architecture
	
	Find the source code under the `src` directory for javascript and `sass` for the stylesheets. Before modifying ensure that the development watcher is running by running the development watch command (see development notes). The `dist` directory holds the files ready for distribution.
